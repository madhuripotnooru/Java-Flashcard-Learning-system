# Java-Flashcard-Learning-system
The Java Flashcard Learning System is a console-based study tool that uses spaced repetition and the Leitner method to improve memory retention. Flashcards are stored in a CSV file for offline persistence, and the system is built using Core Java with a simple menu interface for adding, studying, and tracking cards.
